Towards Sustainable Aquaculture: An IoT-Driven Fish Farming System
The IoT-based indoor fish farming system presented in this project addresses critical challenges in aquaculture by integrating technology and automation. The escalating demand for fish as a primary protein source, coupled with limited land availability, necessitates innovative solutions to optimize fish farming.

Our system employs sensors to monitor and control essential parameters: pH levels, temperature, and automated feeding. When pH deviates from the optimal range, a corrective process is initiated. Temperature is regulated through submersible pumps, and daily water changes maintain water quality. Automated feeding ensures fish receive the correct nutrition, with real-time monitoring and alerts.

The mobile application interface provides user-friendly access to real-time data, allowing for user input and adjustments. Data analysis processes ensure optimal pH, temperature, and feeding schedules. This IoT-based system enhances the efficiency of indoor fish farming, making it an adaptable and sustainable solution for meeting the growing demand for fish protein.
